# Text-Editor

## Overview
This app is a text editor, which allows the user to write some code into it, which is then saved to local storage. This allows the user to be able to continue even without continued internet connectivity. 

## Technologies
The Text Editor app is built using the Progressive Web Application (PWA) standards including a service worker file, webpack.config, and incorporates Express. 

## Deployment
This app has unfortunately not been deployed to Heroku successfully. It seems to be an issue affecting the whole class, and from what we can tell could be an issue beyond our control with the starter code or Heroku itself. In place of a link to the deployed version I am including a video which demonstrates the appearance and functionality of the app in use.
